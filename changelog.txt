pseudoelliposchengband
======================
Changelog versus elliposchengband, as of May 06, 2017:

Significant gameplay changes:
-----------------------------
- Added the easy_quests option, which allows leaving the floors of Angband's random quests without failing them, similar to the effects of the ironman_quests option from version 5.0
- Rune Knights reverted back to the vanilla class instead of ellipcb's nerf/rework.

Minor gameplay changes:
-----------------------
- Having easy_id on lets nonmagical classes like warrior pseudo-ID lights and jewelry in the same way that mages do. 
- Items that give "auto pseudo-ID" also now improve pseudo-id by letting warrior-types sense jewelry and lights, and letting mage-types differentiate between good/excellent/special. 
- The wand of clone monster is back, for those who enjoyed scumming with it. 
- Bard and high-mage of hex no longer lose a turn when a monster's dispel-magic cancels an active song or chant. 
- Rings' spellcasting interface has been changed around so that spells always use the same letter instead of moving around each time they learn a new power. 
- Several spells which could only possibly be gained from lucky randart jewelry have been removed from rings' spell list. 
- For the purposes of autodestroyer settings, feanorian lamps now count as 'rare' rather than 'common'. 

Interface changes:
------------------
- Add a "simple stat display" option to show stats as numbers out of 40 instead of 18/220. 
- When the player gets to choose a stat to increase, their stat maximums are displayed if known. 
- The Bard's Clairaudience song no longer spams the player with messages.
- Below their speed on the character sheet, the player can see their actual multiplier to energy. +10 speed is twice as fast as +0, but +30 isn't exactly 4x as fast. 
- The player's speed is highlighted in orange when they are simultaneously hasted and slowed, instead of appearing that they have neither effect.

Bug fixes:
----------
- Rogues who choose burglary as their realm use dex as their spell stat (as they are supposed to), instead of having some things depend on dex and others on int.
- Getting auto_id at level 25 properly checks the easy_id option instead of easy_lore.
- Canceling the targetting prompt or killing your target monster now properly resets your target to nothing instead of buggily choosing a random tile. 
- Messages when your gear is disenchanted or corroded now use the correct slot letter. 
- Monster-race Rings don't get messages for gaining a new power if it isn't actually on their list of castable spells.
